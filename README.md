# Honey - a PayPal Extension

Following an expos√© by [MegaLag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk), I've unpacked Honey's extension source from the `.xpi` downloadable from the [Firefox Add-On](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/honey/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) page.

I believe Honey to be malicious software, whose intent was to deceive marketing partners and consumers alike.
